Preheat oven to 375º and brush a standard 9”-x-5” loaf pan with butter.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cloves, and nutmeg until well combined. 
In another large bowl, whisk together butter, bananas, eggs, buttermilk, molasses, and vanilla until smooth. 
Add dry ingredients and walnuts to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Scrape into prepared pan and spread into an even layer.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then transfer loaf to a wire rack and let cool completely. 
In a medium bowl, whisk the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of the milk until combined. Add milk, ½ teaspoon at a time if too thick. Spread glaze over top of loaf and sprinkle with remaining walnuts. Let set at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
